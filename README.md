Interesting project inspired by 'Whack a Mole' game !

# About the project

It is pretty obvious that inspiration for this project came from
       well known

       original game. As I began developing, I decided to use as much as
       possible of my personal graphic resources, such as
       <a

         >bullet holes images</a

       etc. Game sounds downloaded from <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank"> here. <a/>
     
       Even though this game could be improved by adding
       extra functionality, such as levels, various choices and options for
       user...I rather kept it simple in order to save a valuable time,
       time I'd rather spend building another project and learning and
       practicing new JavaScript skills, as this one in my opinion
       fulfilled it's purpose.
